			Cut half a sheet of algae, lay it on the mat with the rough side up.
			Put the seasoned rice on the seaweed in a dense, even layer, leaving only the upper edge free (1.5 cm is enough).
			Now turn the workpiece so that the rice is at the bottom, and the free edge of the seaweed is closer to you. In the center along the entire width, add fish, vegetables cut into straws and pour mayonnaise over everything.
			Roll the mat in the form of a roll, carefully holding the filling with your index fingers.
			We roll the resulting roll in sesame seeds and with a sharp knife, previously moistened with water, cut it into eight equal parts. To make the dish look more elegant, we can use a mixture of black and white seeds, and in order to emphasize their nutty taste, lightly fry the seeds in a dry pan.
			We recommend serving ready-made rolls with unaga soy sauce, ginger petals and wasabi.</p>
